/**
 * Enables telemetry collection with OpenTelemetry for Azure AI clients and popular GenAI libraries.
 *
 * Following instrumentations are enabled (when corresponding packages are installed):
 * - Azure AI Agents (`@azure/ai-agents`)
 * - Azure AI Inference (`@azure-rest/ai-inference`)
 * - OpenAI (`@traceloop/instrumentation-openai`)
 * - Langchain (`@traceloop/instrumentation-langchain`)
 *
 * When destination is provided, the method configures OpenTelemetry SDK to export traces to
 * stdout or OTLP (OpenTelemetry protocol) gRPC endpoint. It's recommended for local
 * development only. For production use, make sure to configure OpenTelemetry SDK directly.
 *
 * @param destination - Recommended for local testing only. Set it to `"stdout"` for
 *        tracing to console output, or a string holding the OpenTelemetry protocol (OTLP)
 *        endpoint such as "http://localhost:4317".
 *        If not provided, the method enables instrumentations, but does not configure OpenTelemetry
 *        SDK to export traces.
